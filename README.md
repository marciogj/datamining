# Datamining Package
This is a simple package used to implement classic dataming algorithms (personal study).
There's no intent to make this code as a official library since there are plenty of better resources already avaliable on the internet.

Every algorithm will be implemented as a easy understating focus instead of performance.

## K-Means
Famous algorithm for clustering which is used to distribute  data into groups (named clusters).
The implementation done so far is an attempt to make it easy to extend for different types like simple numbers, gps data and so far.
